# Virtual Machines vs. Containers

Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers are both technologies used to run applications in isolated environments, but they use different approaches. A VM includes a complete guest operating system and runs on a virtualized hardware layer, while a container shares the host operating system and isolates applications as processes.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**        | Each VM includes a complete Guest OS and runs on virtualized hardware through a hypervisor. | Containers share the Host OS kernel and run applications as isolated processes.   |
| **Boot Time**           | Usually takes minutes because the entire Guest OS needs to start.                           | Usually starts in seconds because there is no separate operating system to boot.  |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Heavy and requires more RAM and CPU because each VM includes its own operating system.      | Lightweight and uses fewer resources because containers share the Host OS kernel. |
| **Isolation Level**     | Provides hardware-level virtualization and strong isolation between virtual machines.       | Provides process-level isolation while sharing the host operating system.         |

### Summary

Containers can be a good choice for web applications because they are lightweight and can start much faster than traditional Virtual Machines. Unlike VMs, containers do not need a complete operating system for every application, which helps reduce RAM and CPU usage. They also make applications easier to deploy consistently across different environments. For web applications that need fast deployment and efficient resource usage, containers can provide a more flexible solution than traditional VMs.
